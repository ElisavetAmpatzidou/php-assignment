# php-assignment
A website which is developed for my Web Programming course (4th semester) in University Of Macedonia. 
It is a website where a user can register as manager or a user and access different pages. As a user you can submit a form with your feedback for our services. And as a manager you can manage these results and more.
If you wish to register as a manager you should give on of these usernames: "elis" or "elisavet".

#installation
In order to explore the app you should clone the project and before you run it you should open Apache and MySql servers from xampp for example.
